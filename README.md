# Option-Pricing
# Overview

This project focuses on option pricing for a selected stock using both the Binomial model and the Black-Scholes formula. The project involves estimating annual volatility, determining the risk-free rate, and evaluating call/put option prices for various strike prices and time to maturity. Additionally, it includes verifying the convergence of the Binomial model, comparing results with actual market data, creating a delta-neutral portfolio, and using numerical methods to calculate implied volatility.

# Project Objectives

    Data Collection: Gather historical price data for the selected stock and 
    relevant options from Yahoo Finance.

    Volatility Estimation: Use the past one-year data to estimate the annual volatility of the stock.

    Risk-free Rate: Utilize the 10-year US Treasury rate as the risk-free rate.

    Option Pricing (Binomial Model): Evaluate call/put option prices using the 
    Binomial model for different strike prices and time to maturity.

    Option Pricing (Black-Scholes Formula): Calculate call/put option prices using the Black-Scholes formula.

    Convergence Verification: Increase the number of steps in the Binomial model 
    to verify that the option price converges.

    Graphical Representation: Draw a graph to illustrate the convergence of the Binomial model 
    as the number of steps increases.

    Comparison with Market Data: Compare the calculated option prices with actual market data to 
    assess the accuracy of the models.

    Delta Neutral Portfolio: Create a delta-neutral portfolio to hedge against changes 
    in the underlying stock price.

    Implied Volatility Calculation: Use numerical methods to calculate implied volatility 
    from market option prices.
